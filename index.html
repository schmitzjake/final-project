    <p>After a decisive Rookie of the Year campaign, the 20-year-old phenom is showing
      no signs of a sophomore slump. But with extensive coverage from media outlets and
      a surge of fanatic online support, could the hype train get ahead of the young star?</p>

  <p>When Luka Doncic was drafted third overall in the 2018 NBA Draft, there was little question that he was going to be something special.
    He had slowly but surely moved into the public's consciousness ever since achieving wunderkind status by winning MVP in an under-14
    international tournament as an 11-year-old. By the time the Atlanta Hawks were on the clock in 2018 the Slovenian guard had come off
    his best season yet, winning the 2018 EuroLeague cup with Real Madrid and gained regular season and Final Four MVP honors. In his final season with
    Madrid, Doncic averaged 16 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 4.3 assists in 33 games. <a href="https://defpen.com/luka-doncic-2018-nba-draft-prospect/">The only doubt</a> in anyone's mind was if it would
    take some time for these numbers to carry over in the NBA. Very quickly, these doubts were erased.<br><br>

In his first season with Dallas Mavericks, who were traded Doncic in exchange for Oklahoma guard Trae Young and a protected future first round pick in 2019,
Doncic averaged 21.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 6 assists in an astounding 72 games. Somehow Doncic improved on his MVP season overseas, rising to the level
of his new competition in a way few have ever done before. After winning the 2018 Rookie of the Year and being unanimously selected to the All-Rookie team,
Doncic was in rarefied air. He finished the season with <a href="https://clutchpoints.com/mavs-news-luka-doncic-has-4-of-the-5-triple-doubles-recorded-by-teenagers-in-nba-history">four of the five</a> triple-doubles recorded by teenagers in NBA history, and his eight triple-doubles
ranked fourth on the season behind Russell Westbrook (34), Nikola Jokić (12) and Ben Simmons (10), as well as tied with LeBron James. In addition, he became
just the fifth player in NBA history to average at least 20 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists in his rookie year, joining Oscar Robertson (1960–61), Michael Jordan (1984–85),
LeBron James (2003–04), and Tyreke Evans (2009–10). And by winning Rookie of the Year honors, Doncic became the second European player, after Pau Gasol, to win the award and
the sixth overall winner not born in the United States.<br id="map-ref"><br>

For his entire life, there has been a crowd of people surrounding Luka Doncic and telling him he's incredible. This historic freshman season did not help. And entering his
sophomore season, the crowd is only growing. <u>And as you can see from the map below</u>, the crowd has had to cross the globe in order to keep following him, from his birthplace of
Ljubljana, Slovenia to Madrid, Spain and now to Dallas, Texas.</p>

  <p>This crowd is no more apparent than on Twitter, where thousands gather after every Doncic performance to marvel over the wunderkind's stellar showouts. Fans and professionals
    alike provide live updates of the guard's most impressive shots, passes, and boards, and join together postgame to collectively shout "MVP!" along with comparisons to all-time
    greats like Lebron, Magic, Kobe, and Jordan. A simple search of "Luka Doncic MVP" on Twitter can provide you a great picture into NBA Twitter fanaticism. <u>Check out the
    tweets below to get a taste:</u></p>

  <hr id="news">

  <p>But amateur fans are not the only people showering Doncic with praise. Esteemed publications like the Ringer, Bleacher Report, Forbes, and <a href="https://www.nba.com/article/2019/11/18/luka-doncic-2nd-youngest-post-40-point-triple-double">the NBA itself</a> report consistently on
    the Dallas guard's talent, already throwing words like "MVP" and "Hall of Famer" around as often as you see with any other player in the league today. Staffers from the Ringer even
    wrote a parody on Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah" titled "<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE23ajVX930'>Halleluka</a>", in which Ringer podcast producer Isaac Lee sings "Every Mavs fan shouted Halleluka." I'm not even sure if Lebron got
    Jesus comparisons this early in his career. And even if he is a future Hall of Famer, with a whirlwind of praise from fans and reporters alike, it could be hard for Doncic to live up to this hype, <u>seen in some news articles below:</u> <p>

  <p id="youtube">Now, I'd hate to be a hypocrite. But I'd also hate to not give credit where credit is due. Luka Doncic is the real deal. <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/doncilu01/gamelog/2020/">Through the first few weeks</a> of the 2019 NBA season, he has averaged a near-triple double
    of 29.5 points, 10.7 rebounds and 9.3 assists in 35 minutes per game. He is in the top five in points per game, top two in assists per game, and top 15 in rebounds per game. He is doing all of this while
    improving on his free throw, true shooting, and effective field goal percentages from last year. Simply put, Doncic is doing more, and more efficiently than he ever has.<br><br>

    Although it is early in the season, it is easy to see that Doncic is doing something special by comparing this year to <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/au/nba/news/dallas-mavericks-is-luka-doncic-best-20-year-old-nba-history-magic-johnson-lebron-james-kobe-bryant-shaq-durant/gmbzg55om1sr1cw2czj3faz90">other historic 20-year-old seasons</a>. So far, Doncic has put up better averages than 20-year-old
    Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, Lebron James, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett, Shaquille O'Neal, Isiah Thomas, and Magic Johnson. All of these players were All-Stars in these years, and Johnson was even selected Finals MVP. In addition,
    Doncic already holds the NBA record for most triple-doubles and most 30-point triple-doubles before turning 21-years-old, with his birthday still three months away. Doncic hasn't even played his 100th NBA game yet,
    and these are the names he's surrounded by. But, hey, numbers can lie. <u>So just look below at any Youtube game highlights</u> from this season to see exactly how special Doncic is. Just click authorize and load, then execute to see the Luka Magic: </p>

  <p>Since he was 11 years old, Luka Doncic has felt the hype. At this point, it doesn't get to him. He can tune it out or he can embrace it, honestly it doesn't really matter. Someone who isn't good enough to warrant this
    attention might let this kind of coverage, the coverage to which I'm contributing, affect their game. Luka Doncic won't let that happen, though. He deserves all the hype.</p>
